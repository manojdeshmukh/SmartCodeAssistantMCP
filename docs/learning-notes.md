# MCP Learning Notes

## What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

MCP is a protocol that enables AI models to interact with external tools and data sources in a standardized way. It allows AI assistants to:

- **Call Tools**: Execute functions provided by the server
- **Access Resources**: Read files, databases, APIs, etc.
- **Maintain Context**: Keep track of state and conversation history

## Key MCP Concepts

### 1. MCP Server
- A server that implements the MCP protocol
- Provides tools and resources to AI clients
- Handles requests and returns structured responses

### 2. MCP Tools
- Functions that can be called by AI clients
- Have defined input/output schemas
- Can perform actions like code analysis, file operations, etc.

### 3. MCP Resources
- Data sources that AI clients can access
- Can be files, database records, API endpoints
- Provide content to inform AI responses

### 4. MCP Client
- AI system that connects to MCP servers
- Makes tool calls and accesses resources
- Uses the protocol to communicate with servers

## MCP Protocol Flow

```
AI Client <---> MCP Protocol <---> MCP Server
    |                                    |
    |-- Tool Calls (execute functions)    |
    |-- Resource Requests (access data)   |
    |                                    |
    |<-- Tool Results (function outputs)  |
    |<-- Resource Content (data content)  |
```

## Our Implementation Strategy

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic MCP server setup
2. **Add Tools Gradually**: Implement one tool at a time
3. **Test Each Step**: Verify functionality before moving on
4. **Document Learning**: Keep notes on challenges and solutions

## Common MCP Patterns

### Tool Definition
```csharp
[Tool("analyze_project")]
public async Task<string> AnalyzeProject(string projectPath)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

### Resource Definition
```csharp
[Resource("project://code")]
public async Task<string> GetProjectCode(string path)
{
    // Implementation
}
```
